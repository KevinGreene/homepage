# Citizen Labs

Citizen Labs is a Grand Rapids, MI based organization that believes engaged citizens can improve their communities.

**We work** together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.

**We are** developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.

### Recent Projects
- [Open Budget: Grand Rapids](http://openbudgetgr.org): The Open Budget project promotes a deeper understanding of the city budget of Grand Rapids, so that citizens, officials, and other stakeholders can engage in more informed dialogue about how the City of Grand Rapids currently works and how it should in the future.
- [Grand Rapids Parks & Recreation Investments](http://grparks.citizenlabs.org/): On November 5, 2013, residents of Grand Rapids voted in favor of a dedicated property millage for capital and pool operations, and major repair and rehabilitation of parks and playgrounds. Our map shows the parks of the City of Grand Rapids and the tax dollars invested in each one thus far.
