<p>Citizen Labs is seeking legal help in becoming a Nonprofit Incorporation, specifically:</p>

<ul>
<li>incorporating as a 501(c)(3) in the State of Michigan</li>
<li>obtaining a Federal Tax ID (EIN)</li>
<li>gaining tax exempt status with the IRS</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the important benefits to Citizen Labs would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>legal status of Citizen Labs by any form would allow us to enter into formal agreements with individuals, organizations, and governments</li>
<li>grants from governmental entities, private foundations, and corporate donations often require  501(c)(3) status. This status also gives the organization the public legitimacy of IRS recognition, an important factor when grant makers are determining funding</li>
<li>legal status would permit the raising of money through services rendered, dues, fundraising, grants, etc.</li>
<li>income could be used to pay for technical infrastructure, meeting costs (primarily food), special events, other organizational expenses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Citizen Labs currently has the following in place:</p>
<ul>
<li>Board of Directors</li>
<li>Approved Bylaws</li>
<li>Currently no officers, but the means to elect</li>
<li>Estimated annual budget of $3,000 to $5,000 (for next 1-2 yrs)</li>
</ul>
