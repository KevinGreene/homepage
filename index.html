<p>Citizen Labs is a Grand Rapids, MI based organization that believes engaged citizens can improve their communities.</p>

<p><strong>We work</strong> together with our community to use open data and open source technology to promote transparency, better understand problems, make better choices, and provide solutions that work.</p>

<p><strong>We are</strong> developers, designers, data geeks, leaders, and idea-makers who volunteer to help local and state governments, and civic organizations.</p>
